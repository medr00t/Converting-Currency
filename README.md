You can install the dependencies using pip with the following command:`pip install tk`

API Key
The script uses the exchangerates_data API to fetch currency exchange rates. To use the API, you need to provide an API key. In this script, the API key is already
included in the headers of the API request. However, please note that the API key may have limited usage or validity.
If the API key is no longer valid, you may need to obtain a new API key from a exchangerates_data website.
